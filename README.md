# equity-index-predictors
A comprehensive survey and research on factors that have predictive power on equity indices


This list consists of an extensive literature survey on equity index prediction and additional factors that I find out during my research on the second project mentioned above. The number of factors for each country reaches to the hundreds. To the best of my knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study on equity index predictors. I also provided a simple script for each factor to retrieve data via Bloomberg Terminal or Reuters Eikon and calculate the factor.
